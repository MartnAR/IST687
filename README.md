# IST687 Introduction to Data Science
This repository has RMarkdown files for every homework assignment for Syracuse University's IST687 Introduction to Data Science Course 
of the Applied Data Science Master Program. 

The homeworks are from the Summer 2018 Quarter and will not be edited after the Quarter finishes on September 27, 2018. 

Each week homework will be uploaded after that week's deadline so as not to provide the immediate solutions to other current students.
