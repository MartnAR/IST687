#IST687 Introduction to Data Science: Week 3 Homework.

#Cleaning/munging Dataframes

#Data is often not in the format that you want/need. So, by "data munging", you have to refine the dataset into something more useful. 
#In	this	lab,	you	need	to	read	in	a	dataset	and	work	on	that	dataset	(in	a	dataframe)	so	that	it	can	be	useful. Then,	we	will	explore	the	distribution	within	the	dataset.

#Step 1: Create a function (named readStates) to read a CSV file into R

#This function calls the URL for the US government census, calls the url through the read.csv() function, and returns the loaded csv, without tidying it. 
readStates <- function(){
  url <- "http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/2010-2011/state/totals/nst-est2011-01.csv"
  states_csv <- read.csv(url)
  return(states_csv)
}
